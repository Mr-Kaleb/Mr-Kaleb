Hello there,👋 I’m Kaleb Worku, a recent alumnus of [Augusta University](https://augusta.edu) with a [Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/bs-it-cybersecurity.php). Go Jags!

- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity awareness and outreach, cybersecurity K-12 education, medical device cybersecurity, python programming, and network traffic analysis. I have taken many information technology and cybersecurity courses, such as Digital Forensics, Defensive Cyber Operations, Web Development, Ethics in Computer Science, TCP/IP Protocol Analysis, and Scripting and Automation.
- 👀 I interned at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) in the summer of 2022, and performed a project researching and beginning to design a Secure Shell honeypot model. I was exposed to technologies used in a high-performance computing environment (Fun Fact: ORNL holds the fastest supercomputer ever known as [Frontier]([url](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/)!) 🖥️
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for the [(ISC)2 Certified in Cybersecurity]([url](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CC?filter=featured&searchRoot=A82B5ABE5FF04271998AE8A4B5D7DEFD) examination.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on eventually preparing for the CompTIA Security+ SYO-601 exam in 2023 or 2024 and renewing my CompTIA Network+ certification.
- 📫 Feel free to contact me to follow my journey on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/kaleb-worku) and my [Website](https://kalebworku.com)
