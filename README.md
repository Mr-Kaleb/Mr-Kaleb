- 👋 I’m Kaleb Worku, a senior and an CyberCorps Scholarship for Service scholar attending Augusta University in Augusta, Georgia, majoring in Cybersecurity. Go Jags!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about cybersecurity and information security careers and topics, particularly medical device security, Internet of Things (IoT) security, and cybersecurity higher-education policy. I have taken many courses in information technology and cybersecurity, such as Digital Forensics, Defensive Cyber Operations, Web Development, Ethics in Computer Science, TCP/IP Protocol Analysis, and Scripting and Automation.
- 👀 I interned in-person at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the summer of 2022, and performed a project laying the foundation of a Secure Shell honeypot model while being exposed to technologies and tools used in a high-performance computing environment (ORNL holds the fastest supercomputer ever known as Frontier!) 🖥️
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on my full-time course load this semester (Fall 2022) while pursuing a research assistantship and participating in extracurricular activities such as the Association for Computing Machinery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on eventually preparing for the CompTIA Security+ SYO-601 exam in 2023 and renewing my CompTIA Network+ certification.
