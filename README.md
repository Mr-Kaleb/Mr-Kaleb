Hello there,👋 I am a follower of Christ, an Ethiopian-American, and a recent alumnus of [Augusta University](https://augusta.edu) with a [Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/bs-it-cybersecurity.php). I am an incoming graduate student, studying _Information Security Management_ starting in August 2025. Go Jags!

- 👀 I am interested in cybersecurity awareness and outreach, cybersecurity K-12 education, operational technology cybersecurity, medical device cybersecurity, python programming, and network traffic analysis.
- 👀 I interned at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) in the summer of 2022, and performed a project researching and beginning to design a Secure Shell honeypot model. I was exposed to technologies used in a high-performance computing environment (Fun Fact: ORNL holds the fastest supercomputer ever known as [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/)! 🖥️
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on eventually preparing for the CompTIA Security+ exam in 2025 and renewing my CompTIA Network+ certification.
  
- In my spare time, I enjoy playing Chess and playing the guitar, weightlifting, playing pickleball, and blogging.
